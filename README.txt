README for VoidStar OS 0.1
Welcome to the first ever build of VoidStar OS, first things first, I wanna thank you for choosing my project, especially because its in alpha, you could’ve chose ubuntu, or lubunto, or heck, even base arch.
But you didn’t, so I wanna thank you.
Now, before getting to the instructions just know that all of the softwares included in voidstar are NOT mine, so all the credits go to their respective creators.
INSTALLATION GUIDE
The file I supplied is in vdi, so if you want to use it in virtualbox, just create a new vm and put in the file.
If you want to use it on a real machine, you should first turn the file into in iso, then flash the iso to your destination drive
